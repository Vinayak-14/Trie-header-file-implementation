# Trie-header-file-implementation

This project contains 2 files - main.cpp and myTrie.h
main.cpp - It is a helper file to just run the myTrie.h file on some sample test cases, you can edit it in your way for different purposes.
myTrie.h - It is the header file that contains various pre-defined functions that are necessary in tries.

# Functions included - 

1) insert - to insert a new word in the trie
2) erase - to delete a word from the trie
3) isPresent - to check whether the word is present in the trie or not
4) size - to get the size of the trie(number of words in the trie)
5) autocomplete - provided a word(or prefix of word) will return a vector of strings containing all the words with the provided prefix.
6) display - return a vector of strings containing all the words in the trie in dictionary order.
7) merge - merge to separate tries into one.
8) position - to get the position of a given word in the trie according to dictionary order.
